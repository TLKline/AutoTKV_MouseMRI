AutoTKV_MouseMRI
==========================

The "AutoTKV_MouseMRI" package consists of the source code, annotations, and MR images for the research study, "Automated Total Kidney Volume Measurements in Pre-Clinical MR Imaging." The study developed a fully automated tool for measurement of total kidney volume (TKV) from MR images of mutant (PKD model) and wild-type mice. This software, images, and annotations are made available so that it may be of use to the scientific and clinical communities. The source codes can be run independently from the command line.
